      # Different modes of thinking

      .menu.menu--left[
      - Focussed

      - Diffused
      ]
      
      ???

      They are exclusivelly. We can't thinking the both ways the same time


      Fucussed:
      When it's necessary concentration, attention in something that can be done automatically. 
      Example: 
      - maths
      - CRUD

      Diffused: 
      When it's necessary to think with criativity, outside the box. With a big picture perspective.
      It construct new neuron conections
      Example:
      - modeling some problem matematically
      - think about code design

      Example in learning a new language:
      - focussed:
        - study grammar, vocabulary, etc at home
      - diffused:
        - talk freely with native speakers
      
      Travel between those modes are key to learn efficiently

      # Memory

      - Working memory

        - 4 chunks of information

      --

      - Long term memory 
        
        - billions of information 

          - time and practice (spaced repetition)

      ---

      # Chunking

      - It is a form of compress information

      --

      - Glue pieces of informaion throught meaning and use

        - turns things easier to remember

        - turns easier to take a big picture while learning (also to see relation with other areas)
        
        - they increase with time

      --

      - Diffuse mode can connect the chunks in creativity way
        - needs double check in a focussed mode

      ???

      "dots" of Steve Jobs can be used here as example
      
      ---

      # How to form a chunk
      
      - Basic principles and context
      
        - using different approaches: bottom-up, top-down, etc

      class: low_utility

      # Learning techniques - low utility

      - Highlight

      --

      - Reread

      --

      ???

      - Highlight
        They are popular and useless for same cause: not require a lot of work, 
        but can be usefull combined

      --
    
      - Mnemonics

      ???

      - Mnemonics
        effectives to memomize a fez keywords. Usefull in few situations    
      
      --

      - Visualization

      ???

      - Visualization
        Usefull only in small amount of texts

      ---
      
      class: medium_utility

      # Learning techniques - medium utility

      - Summary

      ???

      - Summary is usufull only in dissertative tests

      --

      - Elaborative interrogation

      --

      - Auto explanation
      
      --

      - Interleaved study

      ???

      - Interleaved study
        we can study more
        we can link the dots in different areas more easily

      ---

      class: high_utility

      # Learning techniques - high utility

      - Practical tests

      ???

      - Practical tests are twice better than the first techniques presented

      --

      - Distributed practice
      
      ???

      - Distributed practice: distribute your study not only in days but short study times in a single day

      ---

      # General tips

      - Distribute and interleave your study helps you to learn more deeply

          - practice and repetition (distributed) build neuronal patterns

          - interleave build flexibility and creativity

          - try to construct relation in different macro fields. It'll improve creativity to solve problems

          - going deeply in some fiel without knowing others can "evolve" you in
            a so familiar way of thinking that you cannot think different and deal with new ideas
      
      ???

      - The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Thomas S. Kuhn)
        - new paradigms are usually discover by new people or people ith knowledge in other fields
          - they are not trapped by einstellung

      ---

      # General tips

      - Try to explain something you think you know

      --

      - While reading, elaborate some questions 

      --

      - Study with different perspectives: texts, analogies, metaphors, models, diagrams, etc.
      
      --

      - Sleep well
